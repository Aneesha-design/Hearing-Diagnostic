Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The Goal of this code is to help individuals self diagnose if they have general anxiety conditions. This code should not be a definitive diagnosis, but could help people seek help should they need it. 
 
Known Issues:
None that I know of! For some reason when I tried adding a comment for the resizing of the image, it wouldn't let me comment so I didn't add a comment for my final change.
